     <p style="color: blue";>
     	Our main Partner is PAX. Who owns 20% of our equity. <br/>
     	We have been in OIL exploration for ten years now, <br/>
     	and we have understood the processes involved to have <br/>
     	a formidable company in the OIL industry. 
     </p>	


     <br/> <br/>
     <p style="color: blue";>PAX has collaborated with us <br/>
     	for six out of those ten years. PAX is key to our success, <br/>
     	and we give them credit because we have had our own fair <br/>
     	share of turmoil in our sojourn in the OIL industry thus far. <br/>
     	We encourage high level of collaboration between our partners, <br/>
     	and this has helped us in all our prior endeavours. We have <br/> 
     	strong industry experience, which has propelled us to great heights.

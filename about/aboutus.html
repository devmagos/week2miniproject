	<h1 style="color: red";>ABOUT US</h1>
	<p style="color: blue";>
		We are a conglomerate of six companies, divided into three core areas. <br/>
		They are OIl, BEVERAGE and Cosmetics. Flax is the arm into OIL. We offer <br/>
		deep sea exploration with a collection of six OIL RIGs in West Africa.
	</p>

	<p style="color: blue";>
		We welcome investors into our OIL arm, since we are still a young growing <br/>
		company in that area who are ready to operate in best practices of the OIL <br/>
		industry. Currently we have one partner who is PAX. PAX collaborated with <br/>
		us to get our OIL exploration license. WE own 80% shares and PAX owns 20%.
	</p>


    <h1 style="color: red";>OUR PROJECTS</h1> 
	<p style="color: blue";>
		We are currently laying a trans atlantic sub sea pipeline, that will span <br/>
		the six countries we have OIL RIGs, and then ontward to Europe, ASIA and <br/>
		the AMERICAS both North and South.
